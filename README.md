# AI Learning Journey - RAG
Overview
This project showcases my recent dive into creating a robust AI solution that answers questions in plain language from a database. Leveraging the power of LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), I've built a seamless and intuitive system integrating various cutting-edge tools.

By combining these technologies, I've managed to:

## ✅ Enhance data retrieval with LangChain and FAISS
## ✅ Simplify environment management with python-dotenv
## ✅ Create an interactive user interface using Streamlit
## ✅ Utilize Sentence Transformers for efficient text embedding
## ✅ Connect and interact with MySQL databases seamlessly
## ✅ Leverage ChromaDB for scalable and fast data access


# Additional Learning
I have also learned to train a RAG model with PDFs and answer questions based on the extracted information. This capability significantly expands the potential applications of AI in document analysis and knowledge extraction.

# Usage
To run the project, ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can install the dependencies using:\
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Streamlit application using:<br />
streamlit run database-qa.py<br />
streamlit run query-data.py<br />

# Future Work
Looking forward to applying these skills to drive innovation and deliver exceptional solutions. The potential for AI in document analysis and natural language processing is vast, and I am excited to continue exploring and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.
