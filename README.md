# AI Learning Journey - RAG
Overview
This project showcases my recent dive into creating a robust AI solution that answers questions in plain language from a database. Leveraging the power of LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), I've built a seamless and intuitive system integrating various cutting-edge tools.

By combining these technologies, I've managed to:

✅ Enhance data retrieval with LangChain and FAISS
✅ Simplify environment management with python-dotenv
✅ Create an interactive user interface using Streamlit
✅ Utilize Sentence Transformers for efficient text embedding
✅ Connect and interact with MySQL databases seamlessly
✅ Leverage ChromaDB for scalable and fast data access
